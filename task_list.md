## Task List

### For September 5

1. Look into possible data sources for D1 Hockey scores.

Here are some potential data bases:

1) https://www.collegehockeynews.com/stats/

2) https://www.eliteprospects.com/games/2023-2024/ncaa/all-teams?from=&to=

3) https://www.uscho.com/scoreboard/division-i-men/2023-2024/list-1/

### For September 12

1. Make a list of teams and conferences from standings.

2. Scrape the league schedule and put data in a tidy format (e.g. get dates assigned, pull out teams not on the team list, have columns of "home_team", "away_team", "date", "score", "ot_or_not", etc.). See 234 notes for a review of `rvest`.


## Update: 08SEP2024

Data set for teams + conference complete.

Having trouble scraping. Used the same exact setup from the DATA/STAT 234 course notes, error codes and R issues galore. I will push the document I'm working in to you, It decribes the issue in more detail.
