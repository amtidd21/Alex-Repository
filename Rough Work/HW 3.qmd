1)



2)



3)

a)
```{r}
r1 = 0.15
r2 = -0.21
r3 = -0.28
r4 = 0.16
r5 = -0.10
n = 60
```

H0: p3 = 0
Ha: p3 != 0

```{r}
r3 = -0.28
sr3 = sqrt((1+2*((r1^2) + ((r2^2)))/60))
(ts = r3/sr3)
```
ts = -2.037419. |ts| > 2 therefore the test statistic is greater than 2 times the standard deviation. Therefore reject H0.

We have significant evidence that the autocorrelation at lag 3 is discernibly different from 0. p<0.05.


b)
H0: p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = 0
Ha: some pi != 0

```{r}
(lbq4 = (60*62)*(((r1^2)/(60-1)) + ((r2^2)/(60-2)) + ((r3^2)/(60-3)) + ((r4^2)/(60-4))))
```
LBQ at lag 4 = 11.06433

```{r}
(1-pchisq(11.06433, 4))
```
p = 0.02585047. Reject H0

We have significant evidence (LBQ = 0.02585047, p = 0.02585047) that there is a discernible difference from 0 in the first 4 lags
