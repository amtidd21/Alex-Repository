##Data sets for SYE (Teams+Conference) and my attempt at sraping and tidying.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(here)
```


```{r}
NCAA_teams <- read_csv("NCAA_teams.csv")
##NCAA Team and conference data set. Teams are encoded exactly as source has them.
```


```{r}
View(NCAA_teams)
```

Data scraping:
```{r}
##For some reason, R will only store my url as an object if it is named "url". Furthermore, the read_html() code has an issue and I'm not that great at scraping to troubleshoot it. Lastly, my url will not appear in my global environment. Will need some help with this.
url <- https:www.collegehockeynews.com/stats/
tab <- read_html(url) |>
  html_nodes("table")
```
