##Data sets for SYE (Teams+Conference) and my attempt at sraping and tidying.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(here)
```


```{r}
NCAA_teams <- read_csv("NCAA_teams.csv")
##NCAA Team and conference data set. Teams are encoded exactly as source has them.
```


```{r}
View(NCAA_teams)
```

Data scraping:
```{r}
url_hockey <- "https://www.collegehockeynews.com/schedules/?season=20232024"
tab_hockey <- read_html(url_hockey) |>
  html_nodes("table")
```

```{r}
test1 <- tab_hockey[[1]] |> html_table()
test1
stats_dirty <-test1
view(stats_dirty)
```

Tidying the data set:
```{r}
##This is possibly the ugliest format for a table. Will need help getting started with scraping
```
